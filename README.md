Main solution:

1. What is the transaction with the highest volume in the timespan
2. What is the average transaction number per day, for each day (would look nice like a graph)
3. What is the most favoured transaction type (selling dollars for euros, for example)
4. Average sale and buy price per day for the most bought currency
5. Total volume per day (graph)
